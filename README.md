This is the code for paper: Hashing for Fast and Efficient Node Embedding.

All code are in src directory. Code running on Python 3.5.2 :: Anaconda custom (x86_64) and Keras 1.2.2.

Example of running:

1. python HashingNetEmbed.py

2. Then the program will ask you to input the dataset path:  “Graph color classify: Please input the filename of dataset:”, you can simply key in “./data/polblogs”, then click enter. (Careful about: don’t add space after the path, or it will show error)

3. The program will give you results on classifications accuracy, lose, and running time
